The evolution of augmented reality (AR), with an improvement in its usability, allows more users to interact with this type of devices such as the HoloLens 2. One of the main fields benefiting greatly of these advances is healthcare, particularly for rehabilitation  and well being. In AR, users are able to see the real world, reducing potential  dizziness caused by other devices. In this paper we present HoloDemTect, an AR application to stimulate the interaction of patients with objects while performing different tasks. They are asked to perform tasks in which their motor and cognitive abilities are stimulated, while the system collects relevant information (e.g. eye tracking, hand positions and head movements) to reconstruct their actions. Our system creates a realistic experience with high immersion that we evaluated  with a set of exercises performed by volunteers by a qualitative and quantitative analysis.
